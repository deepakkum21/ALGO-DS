Find the largest rectangular area possible in a given histogram where the largest rectangle can be made of a number of contiguous bars. For simplicity, assume that all bars have same width and the width is 1 unit. 
For example, consider the following histogram with 7 bars of heights {6, 2, 5, 4, 5, 1, 6}. The largest possible rectangle possible is 12 (see the below figure, the max area rectangle is highlighted in red)

steps:- 
1. first perform NSR by INDEX => save in ListRight
2. first perform NSL by INDEX => save in listLeft
3. Area[i] = arr[i] * (ListRight[i] - listLeft[2] - 1)
4. then find max from Area array
