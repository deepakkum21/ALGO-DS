use queue for storing max
while hiting the 1st window add each no to the queue
    condition :- 1. if the no adding to queue is larger than the no present ahead pop those no to the queue 
                 2. if the no is smaller than the no present ahead then simply add that no to the queue
in this way the larger no will always be present at index 0 
when moving the window check if the no removed from the window is the no at 0 index of the queue then remove from the queue
if not then keep as it is 
when adding the no in the window follow the condition mentioned above in conditions.
